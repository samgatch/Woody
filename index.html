					<h4>INSTALLATION</h4>

					<h4>CLEANING AND REPAIR</h4>
					<h5><em>"But my house is clean, why would I need to clean my fireplace?"</em></h5>
					<p>Even if you have the cleanest of homes, do you dust and vacuum your fireplace?  We didn't think so.  Gas Logs and fireplaces (similar to your furnace) function best when they are regularly cleaned and serviced. 
					We have many happy customers who believed there units to be defective or in need of replacement only to discover that a good cleaning and service set them on the right
					track.  However, there are times that parts and pieces are defective and repair is necessary.  We offer full service on all makes and models of Fireplaces, Gas Logs, Wall Heaters, and Stoves.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="cap">
					<h4>CHASE CAP REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT</h4>
					<h5><em>"There is rust running down the side of my chase"</em></h5>
					<p>Fireplace chase caps are typically made of galvanized metal, and do need to replaced periodically.  We offer a wide variety of custom chase caps in multiple colors and designs.  Let us insure that your home is dry, safe, and secure.</p>
